 ## Toggle Theme
 
 hello(vanakkam)! Thanks for viewing my projects!🙏

 ### I made it to practice my theme logic.

 📺[live demo](https://themeSwitch.netlify.app)

 📝Notes:

   - Used CSS variables to name colors.
   - Created two style class, Dark theme and Light theme.
   - Used Js to toggle the class when theme button is clicked.
